						<h1>About Me</h1><br>

						<p>I am an Embedded Applications Specialist currently for Convergint Technologies. I studied Computer Science at the University of Westminster. I consider myself a focused and results-driven individual, who is knowledgeable in multiple computer languages. I love a challenge, but I also enjoy working in highly functional teams. I am willing and enthused to resolve challenges in the most efficient manner. I am seeking a position in Software Development where I can create and test various programs and packages.
						<br><br>
						I started studying Computer Science because of the fact that there are so many possible solutions to one problem and I love the fact that there is an endless amount of learning and the community is always available to answer questions. I'd say that I'm a forward-thinking Software Engineer with background working productively in dynamic environments. Working within different environments has allowed me to branch out and learn new skills as well as new languages. Thanks to this, I am fluent in several programming languages that consist of Python, Java, Javascript and C - which are all some of the most used languages in the industry to date.
						<br><br>
						Working in a team has always been the best way for me to work. It has made me extremely detail-oriented, organized incredibly time concious. These skills can't be taught but in a team, you can learn so much because the work dynamic is slightly different. Everyone has a role and each person's skillset is utilised.I am team player that is focused on achieving project objectives with speed and accuracy,, while also raising the standard of the rest of the team; making me a valuable addition to a workforce.
