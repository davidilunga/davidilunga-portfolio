				<p>Over the past few years, I have been constantly building on my coding ability, trying to improve and get better. In doing so, i have come across and created, as well as modified pieces of code to do various tasks or are a part of some larger projects.
					<br><br>
					These have all been done in various languages, including the likes of Python, Java, Flutter, HTML, CSS, C# and many more. Please click on the language that you would like to explore:</p><br>
